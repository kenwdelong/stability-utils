Stability Utilities
===================
This is a set of utility classes and libraries that help with making servers operate safely under high load.  Most of these ideas come from 
Michael Nygard's book _Release It_, although a couple are my own invention.

# Performance Monitoring
Package **com.kendelong.util.performance**.  This is a simple Spring interceptor which wraps the joinpoints specified by the pointcuts in
 _PerformanceMonitoringAspect_ 
and adds monitoring of calls, min/max/avg execution time, and exceptions.  The results are exported via JMX as HTML tables (see my jmx-console
project, also in Github at https://github.com/kenwdelong/jmx-console).  The HTML is generated by the Groovy class _ReportFormatter_.

One thing that has not been battle-tested: in this incarnation, I put all the monitors into a Map inside _PerformanceMonitoringAspect_.  If the 
system was under
high load, this access point could become a bottleneck. In a previous 
incarnation (http://www.jroller.com/kenwdelong/entry/performance_monitoring_with_spring_aop),
I exported each monitor individually, although this is not as elegant and involves messing with Spring's AOP facilities in a nasty way. 
If I can't figure out
a way to make this nicer, I might include that impl too.

Another bug is that if I wrap controllers, they cease to be visible to Spring as controllers. This is unfortunate because wrapping all Controllers
is awesome, it allows you to see exactly what URLs are getting traffic in production. We used to use this data to decide what we could retire.
